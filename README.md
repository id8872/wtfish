AI Fish LoggerA simple web app to help anglers in Ontario identify a fish from a photo and provides a quick link to log the catch on the official Fish ON-Line website.FeaturesMobile-First Design: Use your phone's camera directly to capture a photo of your catch.AI-Powered Identification: Leverages the Google Gemini API to identify the fish species from the image.Image Resizing: Automatically downsizes large photos taken on mobile devices to ensure fast and reliable analysis.Secure API Handling: Uses a Vercel Serverless Function to keep the Google API key secure and private.Simple Workflow: Provides clear, step-by-step instructions for the user to complete their catch log on the official government website.How It WorksThe application streamlines the process of logging a fish catch into two main steps:Identify: The user uploads or takes a picture of their fish. The app sends this image to a secure backend function, which gets an identification from the Google Gemini API and returns the species name to the user.Log: After a successful identification, the user is presented with a button that opens the Fish ON-Line website, along with clear instructions on how to navigate their site to record the catch details.Tech StackFrontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScriptBackend: Node.js running on a Vercel Serverless FunctionPlatform: Deployed on VercelCore AI Service: Google Gemini APISetup and DeploymentTo deploy your own version of this application, follow these steps:Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
