    "Brook Trout": {
      "name": "Brook Trout",
      "scientificName": "Salvelinus fontinalis",
      "description": "A species of freshwater char native to Eastern North America. They are prized for their beautiful coloration, typically olive-green to dark brown with a distinctive marbled pattern (vermiculations) on their back and dorsal fin. Their flanks are adorned with red dots surrounded by blue halos.",
      "habitat": "Brook Trout thrive in clear, cool, well-oxygenated streams, rivers, and lakes. They prefer water temperatures between 13-18°C (55-64°F) and are often found in areas with gravel bottoms, underwater springs, and ample cover like undercut banks, fallen logs, and large rocks.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Their diet is opportunistic and includes a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans (like freshwater shrimp), leeches, small fish, and worms.",
        "times": "They are most actively feeding during the low-light hours of dawn and dusk. They will also feed opportunistically throughout the day, especially on overcast days or after a rainfall that washes insects into the water."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Small spinners (like Mepps or Panther Martins), spoons, and tiny jigs are very effective. In streams, fly fishing with patterns like the Adams, Royal Wulff, or various nymphs and streamers is a classic and highly effective method.",
        "bait": "Live bait such as worms, minnows, or insects (like grasshoppers) drifted through pools and undercuts can be irresistible.",
        "technique": "Focus on stealth, as Brook Trout are easily spooked. Cast upstream and let your lure or bait drift naturally down into likely holding spots like pools, eddies, and behind rocks."
      }
    },
    "Lake Trout": {
      "name": "Lake Trout",
      "scientificName": "Salvelinus namaycush",
      "description": "The largest of the char species, Lake Trout are native to cold, deep lakes across North America. They have a forked tail and a grey to greenish body with light, irregular-shaped spots. They can grow to very large sizes, making them a popular target for trophy anglers.",
      "habitat": "They are a cold-water species, preferring deep, oligotrophic (low-nutrient) lakes. In the summer, they retreat to the cold, oxygen-rich depths (the thermocline), often 15-30 meters (50-100 feet) or deeper. In spring and fall, they can be found in shallower waters.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Primarily a fish-eater (piscivore), their main forage includes cisco (herring), smelt, sculpins, and alewives. They will also consume crustaceans and insects when available.",
        "times": "Feeding can occur throughout the day in the deep water they inhabit. Their activity may peak in the morning and evening when they move vertically in the water column to follow baitfish."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Heavy spoons (like the Williams Wabler or Sutton Spoon), jigs tipped with minnows or soft plastics, and deep-diving crankbaits are staples. Trolling with downriggers or wire-line setups is the most common method to reach deep-water fish in the summer.",
        "bait": "Large minnows or dead cisco fished on the bottom or suspended at the thermocline can be very effective.",
        "technique": "Vertical jigging directly over marked fish on a fish finder is a highly effective and engaging technique. In spring and fall when they are shallower, casting heavy spoons or crankbaits towards rocky points and drop-offs can be successful."
      }
    },
    "Walleye": {
      "name": "Walleye",
      "scientificName": "Sander vitreus",
      "description": "A member of the perch family, the Walleye is one of Ontario's most popular game fish, prized for its delicious white flesh. It's named for its large, opaque, 'glassy' eyes, which help it see in low-light conditions. Their coloration is typically olive and gold, with a dark-spotted dorsal fin.",
      "habitat": "Walleye are found in a variety of habitats, from large, clear lakes to turbid rivers and reservoirs. They relate to structure like weed beds, rock piles, sand bars, and underwater points, and will often move between shallow and deep water depending on the time of day and season.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Primarily feed on other fish like perch, minnows, and shiners. They also eat insects, crayfish, and leeches.",
        "times": "They are most active in low-light conditions, with prime feeding times at dawn, dusk, and throughout the night. They are also known to feed actively on windy, overcast days, which creates a 'walleye chop' on the water surface."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Jigs are the most versatile walleye lure. Tip them with a minnow, leech, or soft plastic grub. Trolling with crawler harnesses or crankbaits (like the Rapala Shad Rap or Hot'N Tot) is excellent for covering water.",
        "bait": "Live bait is extremely effective. Minnows, leeches, and nightcrawlers are the top three choices.",
        "technique": "Drifting or slow-trolling with a jig-and-minnow combination near the bottom is a classic technique. Target wind-blown points and shorelines where baitfish are pushed in."
      }
    },
    "Northern Pike": {
      "name": "Northern Pike",
      "scientificName": "Esox lucius",
      "description": "A long, slender, and aggressive predatory fish known for its explosive strikes. They have a duck-billed snout filled with sharp teeth and are typically bluish-green to grey with horizontal rows of light-colored, bean-shaped spots. They are voracious ambush predators.",
      "habitat": "Pike prefer weedy, shallow, and relatively warm bays in lakes, as well as slow-moving rivers. They use vegetation like lily pads, cabbage weeds, and reed beds as cover to ambush their prey.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "They will eat almost anything that swims, including perch, suckers, cisco, and even small ducks or muskrats. They are not picky eaters.",
        "times": "Pike can be active throughout the day, but often have periods of peak activity in the morning and mid-afternoon. They are sight-feeders, so they are most active during daylight hours."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Anything flashy and noisy works well. Large spoons (like the Daredevle), inline spinners (Mepps Musky Killer), spinnerbaits, and large crankbaits are all excellent choices. Topwater lures can provide exciting surface strikes.",
        "bait": "Large live or dead baits like suckers or chubs fished under a large float (a 'quick-strike rig' is recommended) are very effective.",
        "technique": "Always use a strong steel or fluorocarbon leader to prevent their sharp teeth from cutting your line. Cast along weed edges and retrieve your lure with an erratic action to trigger strikes."
      }
    },
    "Yellow Perch": {
      "name": "Yellow Perch",
      "scientificName": "Perca flavescens",
      "description": "A popular panfish known for its excellent taste. Yellow Perch have a yellow to brass-colored body with 6-8 dark, vertical bars on their sides and bright orange lower fins. They are a schooling fish, so where you find one, you'll often find many.",
      "habitat": "Found in a wide range of habitats, from weedy shallow lakes to the deep waters of the Great Lakes. They often school near weed beds, drop-offs, and other underwater structures.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Their diet consists of small minnows, insect larvae, crustaceans, and worms.",
        "times": "Perch can be caught year-round and are active throughout the day. They are also a very popular target for ice fishing."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Small jigs tipped with soft plastics, tiny spinners, and small spoons are effective.",
        "bait": "The most common and effective method is using a small minnow on a hook or small jig, fished under a slip float or directly on the bottom with a spreader rig.",
        "technique": "Look for schools of perch using a fish finder or by drifting until you get a bite, then anchor. They often bite very lightly, so a sensitive rod tip is helpful."
      }
    },
    "Smallmouth Bass": {
      "name": "Smallmouth Bass",
      "scientificName": "Micropterus dolomieu",
      "description": "Often called 'bronzebacks,' Smallmouth Bass are renowned for being one of the hardest-fighting freshwater fish for their size. They are typically brown or bronze with dark vertical bars, and their upper jaw does not extend past the rear of their eye. They are powerful and acrobatic fighters.",
      "habitat": "They prefer cooler, clearer water than their largemouth cousins. Look for them in lakes and rivers with rocky bottoms, gravel shoals, underwater points, and drop-offs.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Their primary forage is crayfish, but they also feed heavily on minnows, gobies, and insects.",
        "times": "Active throughout the day, with peaks in the morning and evening. They will often move into shallower rocky areas to feed during these times."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Tube jigs that imitate crayfish are a top choice. Spinnerbaits, jerkbaits, and topwater lures like poppers and 'walk-the-dog' style baits are also very effective. Ned rigs are another excellent finesse option.",
        "bait": "Live crayfish and minnows are excellent choices.",
        "technique": "Drag tube jigs or other crayfish imitations slowly along rocky bottoms. Work topwater lures early and late in the day. Smallmouth are aggressive, so a faster retrieve can often trigger a strike."
      }
    },
    "Largemouth Bass": {
      "name": "Largemouth Bass",
      "scientificName": "Micropterus salmoides",
      "description": "One of the most popular game fish in North America. The Largemouth Bass is identified by its large mouth, where the upper jaw extends well beyond the rear of the eye. They have a dark, horizontal stripe running down their side and prefer warmer, weedier water than smallmouth.",
      "habitat": "Look for them in shallow, weedy bays, around lily pads, fallen trees ('laydowns'), docks, and thick vegetation. They are ambush predators that use this cover to their advantage.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Opportunistic feeders that will eat anything they can fit in their mouth, including baitfish, frogs, crayfish, and insects.",
        "times": "Most active during low-light periods of dawn and dusk, especially in the summer. On hot, sunny days, they will often retreat to the shade of heavy cover."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "A wide variety of lures work. Soft plastic worms (fished Texas-rigged or wacky-style), jigs, spinnerbaits, and topwater frogs are all classic largemouth lures.",
        "bait": "Large minnows or frogs can be effective.",
        "technique": "Cast your lures into and around heavy cover where bass are likely hiding. Use weedless lures to avoid getting snagged. Topwater fishing for largemouth in the evening can be incredibly exciting."
      }
    },
    "Sunfish": {
      "name": "Sunfish",
      "scientificName": "Lepomis",
      "description": "A general term for several species of panfish, including Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, and Rock Bass. They are typically small, round-bodied fish known for their vibrant colors and willingness to bite, making them a fantastic fish for beginners and kids.",
      "habitat": "Sunfish are found in shallow, warm water around weeds, docks, and fallen trees. They are common in almost all lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers in Ontario.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "They eat insects, small worms, crustaceans, and fish eggs.",
        "times": "Active throughout the day, especially on sunny afternoons."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Tiny jigs, small spinners, and micro-sized soft plastics work well.",
        "bait": "A small piece of worm on a small hook fished under a float is the most classic and effective method.",
        "technique": "Simply find a weedy shoreline or a dock, rig up a hook and bobber, and have fun. They are aggressive and easy to catch."
      }
    },
    "Muskellunge": {
      "name": "Muskellunge",
      "scientificName": "Esox masquinongy",
      "description": "Known as 'the fish of 10,000 casts,' the Muskellunge (or Musky) is the apex predator in many Ontario waters. They are a larger, more elusive relative of the Northern Pike, with a light body covered in dark vertical bars or spots. Catching one is considered a top freshwater achievement.",
      "habitat": "They are found in a wide range of lake and river types but often relate to specific structures like large weed beds, rocky points, saddles between islands, and deep-water drop-offs.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Almost exclusively large fish, such as suckers, cisco, and walleye. They are ambush predators that stalk their prey before attacking with incredible speed.",
        "times": "Can be active at any time, but peak periods often coincide with major and minor solunar phases. Many dedicated musky anglers believe cloudy, windy weather with a falling barometer is prime time."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Musky fishing requires specialized, heavy-duty gear. Lures are very large and include bucktail spinners ('cowgirls'), large soft plastics ('bulldawgs'), massive crankbaits, and topwater 'walk-the-dog' style baits.",
        "bait": "Using large live suckers on a quick-strike rig is also a popular method.",
        "technique": "Always perform a 'figure 8' with your lure at the side of the boat before recasting, as many muskies will follow the lure and strike at the last second. A proper catch-and-release cradle and tools are essential for the health of these magnificent fish."
      }
    },
    "Crappie": {
      "name": "Crappie",
      "scientificName": "Pomoxis",
      "description": "There are two species in Ontario: Black Crappie and White Crappie. They are deep-bodied panfish known for their large mouths and schooling nature. Black Crappie are darker with a random pattern of black specks, while White Crappie are lighter with distinct vertical bars.",
      "habitat": "Crappie are often found suspended in the water column around submerged structures like weed lines, brush piles, and bridge pilings. In spring, they move into shallow, weedy bays to spawn.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "Their primary food source is small minnows and other small fish. They also eat insects and crustaceans.",
        "times": "Like walleye, they are most active during low-light periods, particularly at dawn and dusk. They are also known to feed actively at night."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "Small jigs (1/16 to 1/8 oz) with soft plastic bodies (tubes or grubs) are the most popular crappie lure. Small crankbaits and spinners can also be effective.",
        "bait": "A small minnow fished on a jig or under a slip float is arguably the most effective technique.",
        "technique": "Use a fish finder to locate schools of crappie suspended over structure. Vertical jigging or casting past the school and retrieving the jig slowly through it works well. They have very soft 'papery' mouths, so a gentle hookset is required."
      }
    },
    "Brown Trout": {
      "name": "Brown Trout",
      "scientificName": "Salmo trutta",
      "description": "A European species introduced to North America, the Brown Trout is highly prized for its intelligence and wariness, making it a challenge to catch. They are golden-brown with black spots and reddish-orange spots (often with blue halos) on their sides.",

    "Atlantic Salmon": {
      "name": "Atlantic Salmon",
      "scientificName": "Salmo salar",
      "description": "Historically native to Lake Ontario, restoration efforts are re-establishing this iconic species. They are a silvery fish with black spots on their body and fins. They are known for their incredible leaping ability and strength when hooked.",
      "habitat": "They live in the main lake basin for much of their life, feeding on baitfish. They migrate into tributary rivers to spawn in the fall.",
      "feeding": {
        "diet": "In the lake, their primary diet consists of smelt and alewives. Once they enter rivers to spawn, they largely stop feeding.",
        "times": "Feeding in the lake is dictated by the location of forage. In rivers, strikes are based on aggression and instinct rather than hunger."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "In Lake Ontario, trolling with spoons that imitate smelt is the most common method. In rivers, anglers often use fly fishing techniques with traditional salmon flies or drift fishing with spawn sacs or beads.",
        "bait": "Not typically used for river fishing, as strikes are not hunger-based.",
        "technique": "Focus on tributary mouths in the late summer and fall. In rivers, target deep pools and runs where salmon rest on their journey upstream."

      "feeding": {
        "diet": "They are omnivorous scavengers. They use their barbels to 'taste' and 'smell' for food, which can include fish, crayfish, insects, and prepared baits.",
        "times": "They are primarily nocturnal feeders, with the best fishing often occurring after dark."
      },
      "anglingTips": {
        "lures": "While not the primary method, they will sometimes hit jigs or crankbaits.",
        "bait": "This is the key to catfish angling. Strong-smelling baits work best. Common choices include cut bait (pieces of fish like sucker or chub), chicken livers, shrimp, or commercial 'stink baits'.",
        "technique": "Use a simple bottom rig (like a slip-sinker rig) to place your bait on the bottom of a deep hole in a river. Patience is key; let the scent of the bait draw the fish in."
